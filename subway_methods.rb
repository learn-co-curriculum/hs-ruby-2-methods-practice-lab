# A subway story

# You hop on the subway at Union Square. It takes about 156 seconds to go between stops and you'll be taking the train for 3 stops. Write a method that calculates how long your trip will take and puts it. 

# While you are waiting for the train you decide to play a little dice. Create a method roll that puts a random number between 1 and 6 (feel free to google "how to generate a random number in ruby").

# The train arrives and you hop on. Guess what time it is? It's showtime! There are 23 people on the train and each person gives the dancers 1.5 dollars. Write a method to yell at them in all caps to stop dancing.

# There is a really enthusiastic rider who keeps shouting "Everything is awesome!" Write a method that puts everything is awesome 5 times. (This may require a little ruby research.)

# You are almost at your stop and you start thinking about how you are going to get home. You have $18 dollars left on your metro card. Write a method that puts how many trips you have left.

# Call your methods below:
puts "The trip will take this long"
# call your method here
puts "While I was waiting I rolled a"
# call your method here
puts "The train dancers should really"
# call your method here
puts "That guy kept shouting"
# call your method here
puts "This is how many trips I have left"
